## 1.	The significance of union and intersection types in Typescript.
Introduction
TypeScript has taken the JavaScript, ensuring static typing that helps developers catch errors early and write more predictable code. TypeScript has many features, I will describe two types those are union types and intersection types. In this post, we'll explore the basics of these types. 
Union Types (|)
A union type initiate a variable to hold values of multiple types, For example, consider a function that handles both strings and numbers:
let value: number | string;
 value = 4; 
 value = "Hello"; 
Intersection Types (&)
Intersection types require a value to satisfy all specified types, merging them into one. If a type has properties from multiple sources, an intersection type ensures theyâ€™re all present. Intersection types are especially useful for creating types that combine multiple roles or properties.
